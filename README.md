Flower delivery app for workers
Developed applications to automate the process of flower delivery. 
The work was carried out in a team of 5 people.
The application for florists allows you to add bouquets using a constructor that calculates the cost of bouquets based on the number of flowers. 
The florist can view orders. In the courier application, you can accept orders and change delivery statuses.
